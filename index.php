            <h3>The real story behind JS performance in mobile web and hybrid apps… because science!</h3>
            <h4>Ryan J Salva, Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjsalva" target="_blank">@ryanjsalva</a></h4>
            <p>
              In the last few years, PhoneGap and Apache Cordova have gained a lot of traction among mobile app developers. Using a shared codebase, JavaScript developers can build apps for iOS, Android and Windows using the same frameworks they use for the web. But mobile apps carry a different set of user expectations. Users expect ""native performance"" – i.e. slick animations, fluid page transitions, snappy load times and instant visual feedback for user interactions. I've talked with developers building some of the most popular control frameworks (e.g. Ionic, Famo.us) to learn how they think about building performance into hybrid apps. In this session, we'll learn from their experience and chase this elusive rabbit with all the tools at our disposal. We'll answer:
              <br/><br/>
              1. By the numbers, what really constitutes "native performance"? <br/>
              2. What pitfalls lead to poor JS performance in hybrid apps? <br/>
              3. How can you avoid the most common performance pitfalls? <br/>
              4. How can you use diagnostic tools to identify problems in your apps? <br/>
              5. What design tricks can you use to get that authentic "native look-and-feel?

                    <h3>Web based 3D Camera Simulator for Perceptual Computing</h3>
            <h4>Princiya Sequeira <a href="https://twitter.com/princi_ya" target="_blank">@princi_ya</a></h4>
            <p>
                This talk is about a web based solution to simulate 3D cameras for prototyping, developing and testing perceptual computing, augmented reality applications without using a physical device. The simulator mimics all of the hardware features of a typical 3D camera like that of Intel’s RealSense or Microsoft’s Kinect. The solution is purely based on JavaScript and easily integrates with the 3D camera’s SDKs. Also, it is platform independent.
                <br/><br/>
                Using this simulator, people can conduct workshops, seminars for a larger audience who would be intending to learn a new technology, but wouldn't be having the required hardware (RealSense / Kinect / Leap Motion). All the sci-fi stuff from movies is no more a fiction, and perceptual computing has made all of this transform into reality. So when all of this is happening, I would love to introduce before the audience the immense possibilities which could be explored through JavaScript and web.

            <p>
                The Node.JS & npm ecosystem is oft praised for it's "culture of extreme modularity", which has led to the proliferation of hundreds of thousands packages on npm. How do modular patterns translate into the construction of evolving, real-world applications?

              Sound in general is a pretty abstract topic for most people. How can one generate and arrange what is, at the end, a simple sum of sine waves going through the air, and make people move on a dance floor?<br/>
              In this talk, we'll deconstruct a prototypical acid-techno track, by live-coding all the sounds (modeled after old analog gear), from scratch, using the Web Audio API.<br/>
              We'll cover the basics of sound sequencing, synthesis, with an historical background. And then we'll dance.

                Life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years, and more than ⅔ of that time was spent on perfecting the cell into the fundamental universal component of life that subsequently empowered the explosive evolution of complex multicellular organisms.<br/>
                This talk will draw ideas from one of the most miraculous structures of our Universe - one which has withstood eons of evolution - and show you the striking resemblance between a cell and an instance object. This newly gained insight will point us to a new approach to class composition other than traditional mixins or traits. We’ll then implement this mechanism using advanced language constructs in ES2015 and beyond, and see how it may help to catalyze the Cambrian explosion of next generation JavaScript apps.

              There's a daily cool new thing in the world of JavaScript you need to know or you will fall behind. Or at least that is how it feels like. Don't feel bad, don't get frustrated.<br/>
              JavaScript is a hot topic and we love to build with it. It gives us control, it allows us to do things our way instead of waiting for browsers and it makes us more efficient. However, there is a flipside to that. It is almost impossible to keep up with the speed of innovation. In this talk you'll learn how we can use JavaScript, how to avoid over-using it and what you can do to play on the bleeding edge without feeling lost.

                <p>
                  The web platform is a wonderful playground of artistic and technical expression. The artists of the web often release amazing creations in the most compact form. But you don't have to be a seasoned developer to express yourself and build your own animations. With a bit practice, anyone can build Audio-Visual demos!<br/>
                  This talk will go through creative coding, the demoscene, and a range of optimization tricks. Then we will work on a little Audio-Visual demo together.<br/><br/>
                  I hope this will inspire new JavaScript artists and bring a dash of creativity to our every day problem solving.
                </p>

                <h3>Node.JS Authentication and Data Security</h3>
                <h4>Tim Messerschmidt <a href="https://twitter.com/SeraAndroid" target="_blank">@SeraAndroid</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The arena of proper authentication and data security standards is often some of the most misunderstood, confusing, and tricky aspects of building any Node site, app, or service, and the fear of data breaches with unencrypted or poorly encrypted data doesn’t make it any better.<br/><br/>
                    We’re going to tackle this field, exploring the proper methodologies for building secure authentication and data security standards. We’ll run through:<br/>
                    - Building on top of OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect<br/>
                    - Node middleware services for authentication<br/>
                    - Working with proper hashing and salting algorithms, and avoiding others, for private user data<br/>
                    - Common auth and security pitfalls and solutions<br/>
                    In the end, we’re going to see that by understanding proper data security and authentication standards, pitfalls, and reasons for choosing one solution over another, we can make intelligent decisions on creating a solid infrastructure to protect our users and data.

                  Electroknit is a craft project to convert graphics into knitted patterns for an electric knitting machine. What does it take to turn a digital image into a physical object like a knitted sweater? The answer is series of image processing operations.
                  As web engineer, we take it for granted &lt;img src="image.jpeg"&rt; displays an image because it is a "digital photo." Let's look at what "a Pixel" is & how you can manipulate for fun with Canvas API & JavaScript.

                <p>
                  Most developers do not get direct access to external Pentesters and their interactions are sadly limited to an exchange of reports and emails. The talk will provide the pen tester's perspective. The participants will hear first hand from a pentester on how they pen test, analyse and exploit web applications. This session will introduce participants to security issues related to JavaScript, JSON and HTML5 and how to identify such issues in the code. Participants will learn how to write secure JavaScript code which leads to fewer security bugs being discovered in the testing phase and therefore spend less time fixing bugs. Emphasis will be on DOM XSS exercises. There will also be a special focus on CORS, covering the abuse of cross domain communications.
