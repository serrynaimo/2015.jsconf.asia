            <h4>Spike Brehm, Airbnb <a href="https://twitter.com/spikebrehm" target="_blank">@spikebrehm</a></h4>
            <p>
                        Over the past year or so, we’ve seen the emergence of a new way of building JavaScript web apps that share code between the web browser and the server, using Node.js — a technique that has come to be known as "isomorphic JavaScript.” There are a variety of use cases for isomorphic JavaScript; some apps render HTML on both the server and the client, some apps share just a few small bits of application logic, while others share the entire application runtime between client and server to provide advanced offline and realtime features. Why go isomorphic? The main benefits are performance, maintainability, reusability, and SEO.
                        <br/>
                        This talk will share examples of isomorphic JavaScript apps running in the wild, explore the exploding ecosystem of asset building tools, such as Browserify, Webpack, and Gulp, that allow developers to build their own isomorphic JavaScript apps with open-source libraries, demonstrate how to build an isomorphic JavaScript module from scratch, and explore how libraries like React and Flux can be used to build a single-page app that renders on the server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spike is a web engineer at Airbnb. He’s currently prototyping the next generation of Airbnb’s front end
              stack, tackling the problem of &quot;isomorphic JavaScript&quot; – building apps that have the flexibility to run
              on both the client and server using the same codebase.

            <h4>Vince Allen, Spotify <a href="https://twitter.com/vinceallenvince" target="_blank">@vinceallenvince</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        Once defined by its limitations, pixel art has evolved into a highly expressive visual style. Illustrators, product designers and artists continually challenge the conventional pixel art sensibility to produce beautiful work for the street, our homes and museums.
                        <br/>
                        Working in abstraction, pixel artists manipulate a simple set of design priniciples. This talk will focus on techniques to render pixel art in a web browser using JavaScript and the DOM. We’ll start by drawing characters and scenes in the traditional 8-bit style. We’ll also set them in motion and create framed-based pixel art animation.
                        <br/>
                        Next, we’ll focus on pixels themselves and how to transform them into autonomous agents. Using the same rendering techniques, we’ll create complex systems out of simple rules. As we try to balance these systems, we’ll observe interesting emergent behaviors. Finally, we’ll learn how to render these systems to HD video using Node.js and Photoshop.

                        Not sure what Content-Security-Policy and Strict-Transport-Security are about? Your web apps are at risk! Security is crucial but can be hard
                        to get right. Luckily for web developers, the HTTP protocol comes with well-thought-out security specifications. Modern browsers implementing
                        those security features are capable of doing much of the heavy lifting for us. It is our responsibility to put the browsers on guard. This
                        talk explores which security headers are especially useful along with when and how to use them.

                        As web developers we treat mobile phones as scaled down desktops. We like responsive design and nice looking buttons. But we can do so much more! That little device in your pocket is equipped with a gazillion sensors, and thus able to connect with the real life. Why not exploit that? It’s time to do crazy stuff with phones!
                        <br/>
                        In a talk that is filled with demo’s Jan Jongboom will throw phones in the air, create a theremin, build a security cam, rip some phones apart, play with the gyroscope and maybe even do some juggling (he’s practicing). And all of that... with JavaScript.

                    <p>
                        The web has vastly evolved since it was first invented. However, the way we write web applications has not changed much from the way we wrote the first MVC web frameworks running on a single server. Today’s web applications run in the cloud with a myriad combination of distributed subsystems. Yet we still write web applications as a monolithic piece of software that runs the same on every server.<br/>
                        Quiver is a new approach to tame the modern web architecture. It learns from best practices including the Unix Philosophy, REST architecture, microservices, and combines them into an elegant component system. With Quiver, a web application is organized as a set of loosely coupled components that are connected declaratively. Quiver makes it possible to create reusable subsystems such that the same application logic can run on vastly different environments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Supporting a multilingual application has been a difficult for a very long time and we are now in a brink of
                        entering a new state where we can do it more easily. Data such as CLDR and technologies such ICU’s MessageFormat is
                        unheard for most people. Yet they are used by global companies such as Google, IBM and Apple. These technologies
                        is now included in a project I have been working on called <a href="http://l10ns.org" target="_blank">L10ns()</a>. In addition to solving complex
                        translation formatting with the help of ICU’s MessageFormat and CLDR, L10ns also solves a very difficult workflow
                        problem associated with translation. My session will focus on all the mayor problems in internationalizing applications
                        and help people use efficient industry best practices and solutions for producing multilingual applications.

                    <p>
                        Let’s say you’ve built a brand spanking new Node app. The Internets smile upon you and it becomes super popular! Suddenly
                        people all around the world want to use it too. And naturally, some of them might want to abuse it for nefarious reasons
                        (think stolen private data and leaked selfies). Now you’re thinking to yourself: How do I solve these problems?<br/>
                        With a sample Express app and some help from PayPal’s open-sourced KrakenJS suite, we’ll show you how!

                        climbing, diving and building reusable UI components and widgets, often at the same time.

                            There are two main challenges in creating a game: starting, and finishing. With the plethora of tools at our disposal, it’s quite easy to embark on our pet projects. But sooner or later, we come across problems. Scope creep, unknown unknowns, fragile code and just life in general. It’s at this point that many games falter by the wayside and are eventually shelved.
                            <br/>
                            In this talk, I’ll take you through my journey of creating my game Trichroma, and share both the technical and non-technical lessons I learned along the way that enabled me to pull it over the finish line and bring it home.
                        </p>

                           <a href="http://dat-data.com/" target="_blank">Dat</a> is an open source tool, funded by the Sloan Foundation in the US as part of their Science Tools research funding, that seeks to enable collaboration workflows on top of datasets of any size. The high level goal of the Dat project is to make it easier to work with large scientific datasets in an automated way, which both saves time and also makes reproducibility easier.
                           The core dat tool is a streaming dataset versioning + replication system developed with a heavy Unix philospohy designed to encourage extreme modularity and enable many third party applications to be built on top.
                            <br/>
                            In addition to the core tool we are also developing tools for building and distributing streaming, cross platform data pipelines based on Node.js and Docker.
                            <br/>
                            This talk will introduce Dat, talk about how we used Node to build it, and show examples of how to use Node and LevelDB to work with very large datasets.

                <h4>Slava Kim, Meteor <a href="https://twitter.com/imslavko" target="_blank">@imslavko</a></h4>
                        <p>
                            Reactive Programming is very useful for building complex user interface and interactions. Unfortunately the most popular form of it is FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) which is not an easy paradigm to learn and use for newcomers. In this talk we will present you a much simpler approach that still preserves all the Reactive Programming properties usually required on day-by-day basis but allows you to use the usual imperative style just in a 1Kb library of pure JS.
                            <br/>
                            This talk is suitable for medium-above average programmers who are interested in building user interfaces (although Reactive Programming might appear useful in other parts of a typical application as well). But it can also be useful for novices as this talk has no prerequisites (unlike the mentioned FRP). There will be a pretty simple code examples with a lot of interactivity on the screen. I promise, it will be a good balance between concepts, examples and fun!

                        <p>
                            In electronic music, a live coding performance consists of a performer improvising a piece of music by coding it in front of an audience, while projecting their code for the audience to see. People get together and dance to these performances at events called Algoraves.<br/>
                            Gibber is a creative coding environment that I originally designed for live coding performances, and it’s created entirely in JavaScript. In my talk I’ll share the audiovisual capabilities of Gibber, what it’s like to perform with it, and how it’s used to teach kids to create electronic music. Along the way I’ll show off some libraries I’ve created that might be useful to creative coders. And finally, I’ll live code some music and visuals that you may or may not dance to.

                            These days, we’re spoiled for choice when it comes to HTML5 game frameworks. But with so many frameworks out there, it’s easy to feel like you might be picking the wrong one for your next (or first) project. Each framework has their own way of doing things, and it can feel like a big commitment to spend time learning a framework before you know everything it’s capable of and if you like its API enough to stick with it.
                            <br/>
                            I’ve used many of the popular HTML5 frameworks over the last few years, and Phaser is my favorite. It’s got everything you’re likely to need (sprites, tilemaps, sound, animation, canvas/webgl, mobile support), a very active community and an extensive suite of online examples (over 320 playable demos).
                            <br/>
                            A conference talk isn’t enough time to show off everything, but I’ll give you a tour of Phaser’s features that you’re most likely to care about. I’ll give you enough familiarity that you’ll feel comfortable getting started with Phaser, and excited by the possibilities.

Some of the most modern and progressive practices in open source are being tested to great success in this relatively new and dynamic community. While the core project has struggled to release and attract new contributors perhaps the future of node lies not in its central project but in the community that is continuing to grow and flourish.
