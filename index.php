            <h3>The real story behind JS performance in mobile web and hybrid apps… because science!</h3>
            <h4>Ryan J Salva, Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjsalva" target="_blank">@ryanjsalva</a></h4>
            <p>
              In the last few years, PhoneGap and Apache Cordova have gained a lot of traction among mobile app developers. Using a shared codebase, JavaScript developers can build apps for iOS, Android and Windows using the same frameworks they use for the web. But mobile apps carry a different set of user expectations. Users expect ""native performance"" – i.e. slick animations, fluid page transitions, snappy load times and instant visual feedback for user interactions. I've talked with developers building some of the most popular control frameworks (e.g. Ionic, Famo.us) to learn how they think about building performance into hybrid apps. In this session, we'll learn from their experience and chase this elusive rabbit with all the tools at our disposal. We'll answer:
              <br/><br/>
              1. By the numbers, what really constitutes "native performance"? <br/>
              2. What pitfalls lead to poor JS performance in hybrid apps? <br/>
              3. How can you avoid the most common performance pitfalls? <br/>
              4. How can you use diagnostic tools to identify problems in your apps? <br/>
              5. What design tricks can you use to get that authentic "native look-and-feel?

                    <h3>Web based 3D Camera Simulator for Perceptual Computing</h3>
            <h4>Princiya Sequeira <a href="https://twitter.com/princi_ya" target="_blank">@princi_ya</a></h4>
            <p>
                This talk is about a web based solution to simulate 3D cameras for prototyping, developing and testing perceptual computing, augmented reality applications without using a physical device. The simulator mimics all of the hardware features of a typical 3D camera like that of Intel’s RealSense or Microsoft’s Kinect. The solution is purely based on JavaScript and easily integrates with the 3D camera’s SDKs. Also, it is platform independent.
                <br/><br/>
                Using this simulator, people can conduct workshops, seminars for a larger audience who would be intending to learn a new technology, but wouldn't be having the required hardware (RealSense / Kinect / Leap Motion). All the sci-fi stuff from movies is no more a fiction, and perceptual computing has made all of this transform into reality. So when all of this is happening, I would love to introduce before the audience the immense possibilities which could be explored through JavaScript and web.

            <p>
                The Node.JS & npm ecosystem is oft praised for it's "culture of extreme modularity", which has led to the proliferation of hundreds of thousands packages on npm. How do modular patterns translate into the construction of evolving, real-world applications?

              Sound in general is a pretty abstract topic for most people. How can one generate and arrange what is, at the end, a simple sum of sine waves going through the air, and make people move on a dance floor?<br/>
              In this talk, we'll deconstruct a prototypical acid-techno track, by live-coding all the sounds (modeled after old analog gear), from scratch, using the Web Audio API.<br/>
              We'll cover the basics of sound sequencing, synthesis, with an historical background. And then we'll dance.

                Life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years, and more than ⅔ of that time was spent on perfecting the cell into the fundamental universal component of life that subsequently empowered the explosive evolution of complex multicellular organisms.<br/>
                This talk will draw ideas from one of the most miraculous structures of our Universe - one which has withstood eons of evolution - and show you the striking resemblance between a cell and an instance object. This newly gained insight will point us to a new approach to class composition other than traditional mixins or traits. We’ll then implement this mechanism using advanced language constructs in ES2015 and beyond, and see how it may help to catalyze the Cambrian explosion of next generation JavaScript apps.

              There's a daily cool new thing in the world of JavaScript you need to know or you will fall behind. Or at least that is how it feels like. Don't feel bad, don't get frustrated.<br/>
              JavaScript is a hot topic and we love to build with it. It gives us control, it allows us to do things our way instead of waiting for browsers and it makes us more efficient. However, there is a flipside to that. It is almost impossible to keep up with the speed of innovation. In this talk you'll learn how we can use JavaScript, how to avoid over-using it and what you can do to play on the bleeding edge without feeling lost.

                            This talk will look at WebTorrent, a BitTorrent client for the browser that fully-interoperates with the regular BitTorrent network. WebTorrent uses WebRTC Data Channels and special "hybrid clients" to connect to the wider BitTorrent network. It’s insane to try this.

                  Feross is currently building WebTorrent, a streaming BitTorrent client for the browser, powered by WebRTC.
                  Before that, he built PeerCDN, a peer-to-peer content delivery network to makes sites faster and cheaper.<br/>

                        <p>
                            There are two main challenges in creating a game: starting, and finishing. With the plethora of tools at our disposal, it’s quite easy to embark on our pet projects. But sooner or later, we come across problems. Scope creep, unknown unknowns, fragile code and just life in general. It’s at this point that many games falter by the wayside and are eventually shelved.
                            <br/>
                            In this talk, I’ll take you through my journey of creating my game Trichroma, and share both the technical and non-technical lessons I learned along the way that enabled me to pull it over the finish line and bring it home.
                        </p>

                  little game called Trichroma. She co-organises the Girl Geek Dinner and Women Who Code.
                  But if you really want to know the way to her heart... that would be food!

                        <p>
                           <a href="http://dat-data.com/" target="_blank">Dat</a> is an open source tool, funded by the Sloan Foundation in the US as part of their Science Tools research funding, that seeks to enable collaboration workflows on top of datasets of any size. The high level goal of the Dat project is to make it easier to work with large scientific datasets in an automated way, which both saves time and also makes reproducibility easier.
                           The core dat tool is a streaming dataset versioning + replication system developed with a heavy Unix philospohy designed to encourage extreme modularity and enable many third party applications to be built on top.
                            <br/>
                            In addition to the core tool we are also developing tools for building and distributing streaming, cross platform data pipelines based on Node.js and Docker.
                            <br/>
                            This talk will introduce Dat, talk about how we used Node to build it, and show examples of how to use Node and LevelDB to work with very large datasets.

                <h4>Slava Kim, Meteor <a href="https://twitter.com/imslavko" target="_blank">@imslavko</a></h4>
                        <p>
                            Reactive Programming is very useful for building complex user interface and interactions. Unfortunately the most popular form of it is FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) which is not an easy paradigm to learn and use for newcomers. In this talk we will present you a much simpler approach that still preserves all the Reactive Programming properties usually required on day-by-day basis but allows you to use the usual imperative style just in a 1Kb library of pure JS.
                            <br/>
                            This talk is suitable for medium-above average programmers who are interested in building user interfaces (although Reactive Programming might appear useful in other parts of a typical application as well). But it can also be useful for novices as this talk has no prerequisites (unlike the mentioned FRP). There will be a pretty simple code examples with a lot of interactivity on the screen. I promise, it will be a good balance between concepts, examples and fun!

                        <p>
                            In electronic music, a live coding performance consists of a performer improvising a piece of music by coding it in front of an audience, while projecting their code for the audience to see. People get together and dance to these performances at events called Algoraves.<br/>
                            Gibber is a creative coding environment that I originally designed for live coding performances, and it’s created entirely in JavaScript. In my talk I’ll share the audiovisual capabilities of Gibber, what it’s like to perform with it, and how it’s used to teach kids to create electronic music. Along the way I’ll show off some libraries I’ve created that might be useful to creative coders. And finally, I’ll live code some music and visuals that you may or may not dance to.

                            These days, we’re spoiled for choice when it comes to HTML5 game frameworks. But with so many frameworks out there, it’s easy to feel like you might be picking the wrong one for your next (or first) project. Each framework has their own way of doing things, and it can feel like a big commitment to spend time learning a framework before you know everything it’s capable of and if you like its API enough to stick with it.
                            <br/>
                            I’ve used many of the popular HTML5 frameworks over the last few years, and Phaser is my favorite. It’s got everything you’re likely to need (sprites, tilemaps, sound, animation, canvas/webgl, mobile support), a very active community and an extensive suite of online examples (over 320 playable demos).
                            <br/>
                            A conference talk isn’t enough time to show off everything, but I’ll give you a tour of Phaser’s features that you’re most likely to care about. I’ll give you enough familiarity that you’ll feel comfortable getting started with Phaser, and excited by the possibilities.

                            The node community has change tremendously as it has evolved over the last 5 years. Some of the most modern and progressive practices in open source are being tested to great success in this relatively new and dynamic community. While the core project has struggled to release and attract new contributors perhaps the future of node lies not in its central project but in the community that is continuing to grow and flourish.
